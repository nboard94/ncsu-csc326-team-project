#Feature: Lab Procedures
#	As an iTrust2 user
#	I want to create and use lab procedures
#	So that patients can have treatments done
#
#Scenario: Add a Lab Procedure
#Given that the lab procedure doesn't exist
#When I login as an admin
#When I navigate to the lab procedures page
#When I select to add a lab procedure with new information
#Then the lab procedure is created
